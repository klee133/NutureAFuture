# NutureAFuture
## Overview
Taking inspiration from AllThingsDonation (a website my team and I created for TreasureHacks 2.0), Nuture A Future is a website aiming to aid the process of donating to children in need while encouraging waste reduction.
Figma wireframe: https://www.figma.com/file/bxNBURco5t0sv4E2UI58K5/Nurture-A-Future?node-id=44%3A28&t=FF3Hgig1TXRbhqus-1

So far, working on the wireframe has given me a better understanding of the properties of each element. I also improved my understanding of using components and variants in prototyping.

## Features
Completed the wireframing for the Home Page. I will also wireframe:
- Account / Message Page
- Search Page
- Payment Page
- About Us Page

Then I will create the website in HTML/CSS/Javascript.
